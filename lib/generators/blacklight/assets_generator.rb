# Copy Blacklight assets to public folder in current app.

# add this next line to your one of your environment files --
# generally you'd only want to do this in 'development', and can
# add it to environments/development.rb:
#       require File.join(Blacklight.root, "lib", "generators", "blacklight", "assets_generator.rb")
#       Blacklight::Assets.start(["--force", "--quiet"])


# Need the requires here so we can call the generator from environment.rb
# as suggested above.
